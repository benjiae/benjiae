### Hi!
#### I'm benjae (or benja if you want), i'm an idiot from south america that does dumb stuff (if i want (like every 2 months or something like that tho))

- 🔥 i also know the basics of like 3 langs (python, rust {which i forgot😔} and c# {which i'm also about to forget})
- 🐦 i also know some on css/html (at least the needed to make a basic startpage for firefox), too scared to learn js
- *knowing = being able to actually do some stuff (i still have to search tutorials for almost everything)
